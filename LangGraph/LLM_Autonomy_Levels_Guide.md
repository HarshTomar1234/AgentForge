## Overview

LLM applications exist on a spectrum of autonomy, from simple deterministic code to fully autonomous agents. Each level offers different trade-offs between control, complexity, and capability.

**Autonomy Progression:**
```
Direct Code → LLM Call → Chains → Routers → State Machines → Autonomous Agents
     ↑                                                                    ↑
Zero Autonomy                                                    Full Autonomy

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Level
1. **Start Simple:** Begin with the lowest autonomy level that meets your needs
2. **Consider Trade-offs:** Higher autonomy = less control but more capability
3. **Evaluate Requirements:** Match autonomy level to task complexity
4. **Budget Accordingly:** Higher levels have exponentially higher costs

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling at each level
2. **Monitoring and Logging:** Add extensive logging for debugging and monitoring
3. **Fallback Mechanisms:** Include fallbacks for when autonomous systems fail
4. **Human Oversight:** Maintain human oversight, especially for higher autonomy levels
5. **Gradual Rollout:** Test thoroughly before full deployment

### Safety Considerations
1. **Bounds and Limits:** Set clear boundaries on what the system can do
2. **Regular Auditing:** Monitor system behavior regularly
3. **Kill Switches:** Implement ways to stop autonomous behavior
4. **Data Privacy:** Ensure proper handling of sensitive information
5. **Ethical Guidelines:** Establish ethical guidelines for autonomous behavior
