            "Final Answer: Based on the detailed market data analysis for AAPL, which includes real-time price, historical performance, market capitalization, price-to-earnings ratio, and earnings per share, here are the proposed trading strategies:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Momentum Trading Strategy:**\n",
            "   - Given the significant 6-month price increase of AAPL, a momentum trading strategy could be effective. This strategy involves buying stocks that have shown an upward trend and selling them when they seem to have peaked. The recent slight increase today, despite the 1-day and 1-month decreases, suggests a potential rebound or continuation of the longer-term uptrend.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Swing Trading Strategy:**\n",
            "   - Considering the volatility in the short-term (1-day and 1-month decreases) juxtaposed with a significant 6-month increase, a swing trading strategy might be appropriate. This strategy focuses on capturing gains in a stock within an over several days to weeks. The trader can take advantage of the natural \"swing\" of the stock prices by entering on pullbacks during the short-term downtrends and taking profits when the price rebounds.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Dividend Capture Strategy:**\n",
            "   - Since the next earnings date and potential dividend yields are important upcoming events, a dividend capture strategy could be used. This strategy is centered on buying shares of AAPL before the ex-dividend date and selling them after the date passes to capture the dividend payout without a significant long-term investment.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Protective Puts:**\n",
            "   - Given the uncertainties and market volatility, using protective puts could be a prudent risk management strategy. This involves purchasing put options to help protect the portfolio against a potential decline in the stock price. This strategy provides insurance against a significant drop and limits the downside risk while allowing participation in the upside potential if AAPL's stock continues to rise.\n",
            "\n",
            "These strategies aim to optimize returns while mitigating the risks associated with AAPL’s market volatility and leveraging the current market conditions and forecasted events.

            "1. **Momentum Trading Strategy:**\n",
            "   - Given the significant 6-month price increase of AAPL, a momentum trading strategy could be effective. This strategy involves buying stocks that have shown an upward trend and selling them when they seem to have peaked. The recent slight increase today, despite the 1-day and 1-month decreases, suggests a potential rebound or continuation of the longer-term uptrend.\n",

            "   - Considering the volatility in the short-term (1-day and 1-month decreases) juxtaposed with a significant 6-month increase, a swing trading strategy might be appropriate. This strategy focuses on capturing gains in a stock within an over several days to weeks. The trader can take advantage of the natural \"swing\" of the stock prices by entering on pullbacks during the short-term downtrends and taking profits when the price rebounds.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Dividend Capture Strategy:**\n",
            "   - Since the next earnings date and potential dividend yields are important upcoming events, a dividend capture strategy could be used. This strategy is centered on buying shares of AAPL before the ex-dividend date and selling them after the date passes to capture the dividend payout without a significant long-term investment.\n",

            "4. **Protective Puts:**\n",
            "   - Given the uncertainties and market volatility, using protective puts could be a prudent risk management strategy. This involves purchasing put options to help protect the portfolio against a potential decline in the stock price. This strategy provides insurance against a significant drop and limits the downside risk while allowing participation in the upside potential if AAPL's stock continues to rise.\n",

            "1. **Momentum Trading**: This strategy involves buying stocks that have shown an upward trend and selling them when they start to decline. Given AAPL's 6-month price increase and the recent uptick, this aligns well with the momentum strategy. However, momentum trading is typically associated with higher volatility and can be risky, which might be slightly above medium risk tolerance. It's suitable for day trading because it capitalizes on short-term movements.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Swing Trading**: This strategy is used to take advantage of price \"swings\" in the market over a short period. It requires careful analysis of market trends and is generally considered higher risk than other strategies due to its reliance on volatility. This may not be the best fit for medium risk tolerance unless closely monitored and adjusted for less aggressive positions. It is suitable for day trading due to its focus on short-term intervals.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Dividend Capture**: The dividend capture strategy involves buying stocks before the ex-dividend date to collect dividends and selling them shortly after. While this strategy can provide regular income, it is generally considered lower risk. However, it is not typically aligned with day trading since it revolves around the dividend schedule rather than daily market movements.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Protective Puts**: This strategy involves buying put options to hedge against potential declines in the stock price.

However, it is not typically associated with day trading because it involves longer-term planning for potential downturns.\n",

            "   - **Risk Management:** Implement a dynamic risk management strategy where the risk-reward ratio is always kept at a minimum of 1:1.5. Adjust stop-loss orders based on real-time market volatility and not just fixed percentages.\n",
            "   - **Volume Analysis:** Use volume as a confirmation tool for the strength of the swing. Higher volume on the breakout or breakdown confirms the trade direction and can be a safer bet for medium-risk tolerance traders.\n",

            "1. **Refined Momentum Trading Strategy:**\n",
            "   - **Trade Selection:** Focus on stocks like AAPL with high liquidity and moderate volatility to minimize risk.\n",
            "   - **Entry Points:** Use technical indicators such as MACD and RSI to identify strong momentum within safer trading thresholds. Enter trades during overbought or oversold conditions that suggest a continuation or reversal of the trend.\n",
            "   - **Exit Points:** Implement tighter profit targets and stop-loss orders, such as a stop-loss at a 1-2% loss from the entry point, to protect capital.\n",
            "   - **Position Sizing:** Employ smaller position sizes to lower risk exposure, aligning with a medium risk tolerance.\n",

            "   - **Risk Management:** Maintain a dynamic risk management approach with a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:1.5. Continuously adjust stop-loss orders based on actual market volatility.\n",
            "   - **Volume Analysis:** Use volume levels as a confirmation tool to ensure the strength of the trade direction. High volume during key movements indicates a more reliable entry or exit point.\n",

            "1. **Momentum Trading Strategy Execution:**\n",
            "   - **Pre-Market Analysis:** Assess the pre-market movement which shows a slight decrease. This might indicate potential buying opportunities if the price is expected to rebound during regular trading hours.\n",
            "   - **Technical Indicators:**\n",
            "     - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** Look for a crossover of the MACD line over the signal line as a potential buy signal, particularly if it occurs near historical support levels.\n",
            "     - **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** Monitor the RSI for readings below 30 as potential oversold conditions that warrant a buy, or above 70 for overbought conditions signaling a sell.\n",
            "   - **Entry Points:** Enter trades based on the MACD and RSI indicators aligning with momentum shifts. For instance, entering a buy position when RSI is below 30 and MACD crosses above the signal line.\n",
            "   - **Exit Points:** Set a profit target of 2-3% above the buying price and a stop-loss order at 1-1.5% below the entry point to manage risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Swing Trading Strategy Execution:**\n",

            " What Is MACD? Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator to help investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling. Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security’s price. MACD was developed in the 1970s by Gerald Appel, and is one of the most popular technical tools, readily available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.\n",
            "Key Takeaways\n",
            "Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator to help investors identify entry points for buying or selling.The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.The signal line is a nine-period EMA of the MACD line.MACD is best used with daily periods, where the traditional settings of 26/12/9 days is the default.\n",
            " Xiaojie Liu / Investopedia\n",
            " What MACD Signals The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.\n",
            " Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.\n",

            "MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA\n",
            "MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.\n",
            "The exponential moving average is an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).\n",
            " Using MACD MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.\n",
            " As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.\n",
            " Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2022\n",
            " MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.\n",
            " Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2022\n",
            " MACD vs. Relative Strength The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is considered overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling a top or a bottom is forming.\n",
            " Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do not have concrete overbought/oversold levels. Rather, they function on a relative basis. An investor or trader should focus on the level and direction of the MACD/signal lines compared with preceding price movements in the security at hand, as shown below.\n",
            " MACD measures the relationship between two EMAs to indicate momentum and potential trade reversals, while the RSI seeks out overbought and oversold conditions by evaluating recent price action. These indicators are often used together to give analysts a more complete technical picture.\n",
            " Both measure the momentum of an instrument, but they measure different factors. The two can sometimes give contradictory results. The RSI may show a reading above 70 (overbought) for a sustained period, indicating an instrument is overextended to the buy side. In contrast, the MACD may indicate that the instrument’s buy-side momentum is still growing. Either indicator may signal an upcoming trend change by showing divergence from price (price continues higher while the indicator turns lower, or vice versa).\n",
            " Limitations of MACD A moving average divergence can signal a possible reversal, but it will also produce numerous ‘false positives’ along the way. False positive divergences often occur when the price of an asset moves sideways in a consolidation, such as in a range or triangle pattern. A slowdown in the momentum—sideways movement or slow trending movement—of the price will cause MACD to pull away from its prior extremes and gravitate toward the zero lines even in the absence of a true reversal.\n",
            " Confirmation should be sought by trend-following indicators, such as the Directional Movement Index (DMI) system and its key component, the Average Directional Index (ADX). The ADX is designed to indicate whether a trend is in place, with a reading above 25 indicating a trend is in place (in either direction) and a reading below 20 suggesting no trend is in place.\n",
            " Investors following MACD crossovers and divergences may double-check with the ADX before trusting a MACD signal. While MACD may show a bearish divergence, a check of the ADX may indicate that an uptrend is still in place. Such a doublecheck may help investors avoid the false bearish MACD trade signal and allow them to wait and see how the market develops. If MACD shows a bearish crossover and the ADX is in non-trending territory (<25) and has likely shown a peak and reversal, investors may be more willing to take the bearish trade.\n",
            " MACD Crossovers As shown on the following chart, when MACD falls below the signal line, it is a bearish signal indicating that it may be time to sell. Conversely, when MACD rises above the signal line, the signal is bullish, suggesting that the asset's price might experience upward momentum. Crossovers are more reliable when they conform to the prevailing trend. If MACD crosses above its signal line after a brief downside correction within a longer-term uptrend, it qualifies as a bullish confirmation and the likely continuation of the uptrend.\n",
            " Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2022\n",
            " If MACD crosses below its signal line following a brief move higher within a longer-term downtrend, traders would consider that a bearish confirmation.\n",
            " Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2022\n",
            " MACD Divergence When MACD forms highs or lows that exceed the corresponding highs and lows in the instrument’s price, it is called a divergence. A bullish divergence appears when MACD forms two rising lows that correspond with two falling lows on the price. This is often a valid bullish signal when the long-term trend is still positive.\n",
            " Some traders will look for bullish divergences even when the long-term trend is negative because they can signal a change in the trend, although this technique is less reliable.\n",
            " Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2022\n",
            " When MACD forms a series of two falling highs that correspond with two rising highs on the price, a bearish divergence has been formed. A bearish divergence that appears during a long-term bearish trend is considered confirmation that the trend is likely to continue.\n",
            " Some traders will watch for bearish divergences during long-term bullish trends because they can signal weakness in the trend. However, it is not as reliable as a bearish divergence during a bearish trend.\n",
            " Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2022\n",
            " Example of Rapid Rises or Falls When MACD rises or falls rapidly (the shorter-term moving average pulls away from the longer-term moving average), it signals that the security is overbought or oversold and may soon retrace to normal levels. Traders often combine this analysis with the RSI or other technical indicators to verify overbought or oversold conditions.\n",
            " Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2022\n",
            " It is not uncommon for investors to use the MACD’s histogram the same way they may use the MACD itself. Positive or negative crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises or falls can be identified on the histogram. Some experience is needed before deciding which is best in any given situation because there are timing differences between signals on the MACD and its histogram.\n",
            " How Do Traders Use Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)?\n",
            "Traders use MACD to identify changes in the direction or strength of a stock’s price trend. MACD can seem complicated at first glance because it relies on additional statistical concepts such as the exponential moving average (EMA), but fundamentally, MACD helps traders detect when the recent momentum in a stock’s price may be starting to fade. This can help traders decide when to enter, add to, or exit a position.\n",
            " Is MACD a Leading Indicator or a Lagging Indicator?\n",
            "MACD is a lagging indicator. The data used in MACD calculation is based on the historical price action, therefore MACD readings lag the price. However, some traders use MACD histograms to predict when a change in trend will occur. For these traders, this aspect of MACD might be viewed as a leading indicator of future trend changes.\n",
            " What Is a MACD Bullish/Bearish Divergence?\n",
            "A MACD positive (or bullish) divergence is a situation in which MACD does not reach a new low, despite the price of the stock reaching a new low. This is seen as a bullish trading signal—hence, the term “positive/bullish divergence.” If the opposite scenario occurs—the stock price reaches a new high, but MACD fails to do so—this would be seen as a bearish indicator and termed “negative/bearish divergence.” In both cases, the setups suggest that the move higher/lower will not last, so investors need to look at other technical studies, like the relative strength index (RSI).\n",
            " The Bottom Line MACD is a moving average, best used with daily data. Just as a crossover of the nine- and 14-day SMAs may generate a trading signal for some traders, a crossover of the MACD above or below its signal line may also generate a directional signal. MACD is based on EMAs with more weight placed on the most recent data, which means that it can react very quickly to changes of direction in the current price move. Crossovers of MACD lines should be noted, but confirmation should be sought from other technical signals, such as the RSI, or perhaps a few candlestick price charts. Because it is a lagging indicator, MACD argues that confirmation in subsequent price action should develop before taking the signal.\n",

            "The RSI is a momentum oscillator that is widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.\n",
            " The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security.\n",
            " The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of zero to 100. The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.\n",
            " In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. It can signal when to buy and sell. Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition.\n",
            " The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it is generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.\n",
            "Key Takeaways\n",
            "The relative strength index (RSI) is a popular momentum oscillator introduced in 1978.\n",
            "The RSI provides technical traders with signals about bullish and bearish price momentum, and is often plotted below the graph of an asset’s price.\n",
            "An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30.\n",
            "In some situations, the RSI line crossing below the overbought line or above the oversold line can be seen by traders as a signal to buy or sell.\n",
            "The RSI works best in trading ranges rather than trending markets.\n",
            " How the Relative Strength Index (RSI) Works As a momentum indicator, the relative strength index compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down. Relating the result of this comparison to price action can give traders an idea of how a security may perform. The RSI, especially when used in conjunction with other technical indicators, can help traders make better-informed trading decisions.\n",
            " Calculating RSI The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:\n",

            "The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.\n",
            "The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.\n",

            " As you can see in the above chart, the RSI indicator can stay in the overbought region for extended periods while the stock is in an uptrend. The indicator may also remain in oversold territory for a long time when the stock is in a downtrend. This can be confusing for new analysts, but learning to use the indicator within the context of the prevailing trend will clarify these issues.\n",

Traders can use RSI to predict the price behavior of a security.It can help traders validate trends and trend reversals.It can point to overbought and oversold securities.It can provide short-term traders with buy and sell signals.It's a technical indicator that can be used with others to support trading strategies.\n",
            " Using RSI With Trends Modify RSI Levels to Fit Trends The primary trend of the security is important to know to properly understand RSI readings. For example, well-known market technician Constance Brown, CMT, proposed that an oversold reading by the RSI in an uptrend is probably much higher than 30. Likewise, an overbought reading during a downtrend is much lower than 70.\n",
            " As you can see in the following chart, during a downtrend, the RSI peaks near 50 rather than 70. This could be seen by traders as more reliably signaling bearish conditions.\n",
            " Many investors create a horizontal trendline between the levels of 30 and 70 when a strong trend is in place to better identify the overall trend and extremes.\n",
            " On the other hand, modifying overbought or oversold RSI levels when the price of a stock or asset is in a long-term horizontal channel or trading range (rather than a strong upward or downward trend) is usually unnecessary.\n",
            " The relative strength indicator is not as reliable in trending markets as it is in trading ranges. In fact, most traders understand that the signals given by the RSI in strong upward or downward trends often can be false.\n",
            " Use Buy and Sell Signals That Fit Trends A related concept focuses on trade signals and techniques that conform to the trend. In other words, using bullish signals primarily when the price is in a bullish trend and bearish signals primarily when a stock is in a bearish trend may help traders avoid the false alarms that the RSI can generate in trending markets.\n",
            " Tradingview\n",
            " What Is a Bullish RSI Number? A number of RSI levels can be considered bullish, depending on whether the market is trending up or down or is rangebound.\n",
            " One bullish signal is when the RSI crosses below 30, where it would be considered oversold. But as noted above, bullish RSI signals are best used in uptrends. In a strong downtrend, the trend can continue well after momentum indicators have hit oversold levels. In addition, any trade entered on this signal may offer limited upside, since you’d likely be trading against a strong, recent trend.\n",
            " Following a strong uptrend, another bullish RSI signal is a reversal after a decline to around 40-50, an area considered support during an uptrend. This is often confirmation of a positive momentum shift back toward the uptrend after a pullback, signaling potential for continued gains.\n",
            " What Is a Bearish RSI Number? Bearish signals from the RSI appear much like bullish ones but in reverse. A basic bearish signal is when the RSI crosses above 70, an overbought level. If this is followed by a move below 70, upward momentum may be weakening, alerting traders to a potential price reversal. But again, bearish RSI signals are best used in downtrends.\n",
            " During a strong downtrend, one bearish RSI signal is a reversal after a rise to around 50-60. This is often confirmation of a momentum shift back toward the downside after a pullback, signaling potential for continued declines.\n",
            " Interpretation of RSI and RSI Ranges During trends, the RSI readings may fall into a band or range. During a strong uptrend, the RSI tends to stay well above 30 and should frequently hit 70. During a strong downtrend, it is rare to see the RSI exceed 70, while it frequently hits 30 or below.\n",
            " These guidelines can help traders determine trend strength and spot potential reversals. For example, if the RSI can’t reach 70 on a number of consecutive price swings during an uptrend, but then drops below 30, the trend is likely breaking down. The opposite is true for a downtrend. If the downtrend is unable to reach 30 or below and then rallies above 70, that downtrend has broken down and could be reversing to the upside. Trend lines and moving averages are helpful technical tools to include when using the RSI in this way.\n",
            "Be sure not to confuse RSI and relative strength. The first refers to changes in the price momentum of one security. The second compares the price performance of two or more securities.\n",
            " Example of RSI Divergences An RSI divergence occurs when the indicator and price begin to reach different levels, indicating a change in momentum that precedes a change in price direction. For example, a bullish divergence occurs when the security makes a lower low but the indicator forms a higher low. This indicates rising bullish momentum and could be used to trigger a new long position.\n",
            " A bearish divergence occurs when price makes a higher high but the RSI makes a lower high. This indicates a possible shift to downside momentum.\n",
            " As you can see in the following chart, a bullish divergence was identified when the RSI formed a series of higher lows as the price formed lower lows. This was a valid signal, but divergences can be misleading when a stock is in a stable long-term trend. In that case, numerous divergences can be seen before a reversal occurs. Using flexible oversold or overbought readings will help identify more potential signals.\n",
            " Tradingview\n",
            " Example of Positive-Negative RSI Reversals An additional price-RSI relationship that traders watch for is positive and negative RSI reversals. These are the opposite of bearish and bullish divergences. A positive RSI reversal may take place once the RSI reaches a lower low at the same time a security's price reaches a higher low. Traders would consider this formation a bullish sign and a buy signal.\n",
            " Conversely, a negative RSI reversal may take place once the RSI reaches a high that is higher that its previous high at the same time that a security's price reaches a lower high. This formation would be a bearish sign and a sell signal.\n",
            " Example of RSI Swing Rejections Another trading technique examines RSI behavior when it is reemerging from overbought or oversold territory. This signal is called a swing rejection. A bullish swing rejection has four parts:\n",
            " The RSI falls into oversold territory.The RSI crosses back above 30.The RSI forms another dip without crossing back into oversold territory.The RSI then breaks its most recent high.\n",
            " As you can see in the following chart, the RSI indicator was oversold, broke up through 30, and formed the rejection low that triggered the signal when it bounced higher. Using the RSI in this way is very similar to drawing trend lines on a price chart.\n",
            " Tradingview\n",
            " There is a bearish version of the swing rejection signal that is a mirror image of the bullish version. A bearish swing rejection also has four parts:\n",
            " The RSI rises into overbought territory.The RSI crosses back below 70.The RSI forms another high without reaching overbought territory.The RSI then breaks its most recent low.\n",
            " The following chart illustrates the bearish swing rejection signal. As with most trading techniques, this signal will be most reliable when it conforms to the prevailing long-term trend. Bearish signals during downward trends are less likely to generate false alarms.\n",
            " Tradingview\n",
            " The Difference Between RSI and MACD The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is another trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line.\n",
            " A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the signal line, is then plotted on top of the MACD line. It can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell, or short, the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line.\n",
            " The RSI was designed to indicate whether a security is overbought or oversold in relation to recent price levels. It's calculated using average price gains and losses over a given period of time. The default time period is 14 periods, with values bounded from 0 to 100.\n",
            " The MACD measures the relationship between two EMAs, while the RSI measures price change momentum in relation to recent price highs and lows. These two indicators are often used together to provide analysts with a more complete technical picture of a market.\n",
            " Both indicators measure the momentum of an asset. However, they measure different factors and may sometimes give contradictory indications. \n",
            " For example, the RSI may show a reading above 70 for a sustained period of time, indicating a security is overextended on the buy side.At the same time, the MACD could indicate that buying momentum is still increasing for the security. Either indicator may signal an upcoming trend change by showing divergence from price (the price continues higher while the indicator turns lower, or vice versa).\n",
            " Limitations of the RSI The RSI compares bullish and bearish price momentum and displays the results in an oscillator placed beneath a price chart. Like most technical indicators, its signals are most reliable when they conform to the long-term trend.\n",
            " True reversal signals are rare and can be difficult to separate from false alarms. A false positive, for example, would be a bullish crossover followed by a sudden decline in a stock. A false negative would be a situation where there is a bearish crossover, yet the stock suddenly accelerated upward.\n",
            " Since the indicator displays momentum, it can stay overbought or oversold for a long time when an asset has significant momentum in either direction. Therefore, the RSI is most useful in an oscillating market (a trading range) where the asset price is alternating between bullish and bearish movements.\n",
            " What Is a Good RSI Number to Use? This question could refer to the time frame used in an RSI calculation. Choosing the right RSI period depends on your trading style, time frame, and market conditions. The default is a 14-period time frame, which provides a balanced response to price changes and is well-suited to swing and position trading. Using shorter periods between 5 and 9 makes the RSI more sensitive, appealing to day traders who want to capture quick momentum shifts, though they tend to generate more noise. Meanwhile, using longer periods, such as 21 to 30, suits long-term investors looking to capture major trends.\n",
            " On the other hand, a \"good RSI number\" could also refer to RSI levels. When the RSI is below 30, it signals that the security could be oversold or undervalued — meaning it could be a good time to buy. When the RSI is above 70, it signals that the security could be overbought or overvalued — meaning it could be a good time to sell. An RSI of 50 signals a neutral balance between bullish and bearish positions.\n",
            " Should I Buy When RSI Is Low?\n",
            "Some traders consider it a buy signal if a security’s RSI reading moves below 30. This is based on the idea that the security has been oversold and is therefore poised for a rebound. However, the reliability of this signal will depend on the overall context. If the security is caught in a significant downtrend, then it might continue trading at an oversold level for quite some time. Traders in that situation might delay buying until they see other technical indicators confirm their buy signal.\n",
            " What Happens When RSI Is High?\n",
            "As the relative strength index is mainly used to determine whether a security is overbought or oversold, a high RSI reading can mean that a security is overbought and the price may drop. Therefore, it can be a signal to sell the security.\n",
            " What Is the Difference Between RSI and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)?\n",
            "RSI and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) are both momentum measurements that can help traders understand a security’s recent trading activity. However, they accomplish this goal in different ways.In essence, the MACD works by smoothing out the security’s recent price movements and comparing that medium-term trend line to a short-term trend line showing its more recent price changes. Traders can then base their buy and sell decisions on whether the short-term trend line rises above or below the medium-term trend line.\n",
            " What Is the Difference Between RSI Divergence and RSI Reversal?\n",
            "RSI divergence occurs when the indicator lags behind price, while RSI reversal signals result from price lagging behind the indicator. Both divergence and reversal signals can be bullish or bearish.In a bearish divergence, for example, price makes a higher high but the RSI makes a lower high. With a negative reversal, on the other hand, the RSI makes a higher high, while price makes a lower high.\n",
            " The Bottom Line All in all, the RSI is one of the most popular momentum oscillators in technical analysis. It is used to measure the speed and change of price movements, providing traders insights into potential overbought and oversold conditions. Calculated using a function of relative strength, the RSI ranges from 0 to 100. Indeed, the RSI, with its overbought and oversold levels, helps traders spot potential reversals, divergences, and trend continuations.\n",

            " What Is a Candlestick? A candlestick is a type of price chart used in technical analysis. It displays the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security for a specific period. The candlestick originated from Japanese rice merchants and traders hundreds of years before becoming popularized in the United States. It was used to track market prices and daily momentum.\n",
            " The wide part of the candlestick is called the \"real body.\" It tells investors whether the closing price is higher or lower than the opening price. It appears as black/red if the stock closed lower or white/green if the stock closed higher.\n",
            "Key Takeaways\n",
            "Candlestick charts display the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security for a specific period.The shape varies based on the relationship between these prices.Candlesticks originated from Japanese rice merchants and traders to track market prices and daily momentum hundreds of years before becoming popularized in the United States.Candlesticks can be used by traders who are looking for chart patterns.\n",
            " Investopedia / Ryan Oakley\n",
            " The Basics of a Candlestick Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2020\n",
            " The candlestick's shadows show the day's high and low and how they compare to the open and close. Its shape varies based on the relationship between the day's high, low, opening, and closing prices.\n",
            " Candlesticks reflect the impact of investor sentiment on security prices and they're used by technical analysts to determine when to enter and exit trades. Candlestick charting is based on a technique developed in Japan in the 1700s for tracking the price of rice. They're a suitable technique for trading any liquid financial asset such as stocks, foreign exchange, and futures.\n",
            " White/Green Candlesticks Long white/green candlesticks indicate that there's strong buying pressure. This typically indicates that price is bullish but they should be looked at in the context of the market structure rather than individually.\n",
            " A long white candle is likely to have more significance if it forms at a major price support level.\n",
            " Black/Red Candlesticks Long black/red candlesticks indicate that there's significant selling pressure. They suggest that the price is bearish.\n",
            " Hammers and Hanging Men The hammer is a common bullish candlestick reversal pattern that forms when the price moves substantially lower after the open and then rallies to close near the high. The equivalent bearish candlestick is known as a hanging man.\n",
            " These candlesticks have a similar appearance to a square lollipop and are often used by traders attempting to select a top or bottom in a market.\n",
            "Traders can use candlestick signals to analyze all periods of trading, including daily or hourly cycles or even minute-long cycles of the trading day.\n",
            " Two-Day Candlestick Trading Patterns Many short-term trading strategies are based on candlestick patterns.\n",
            " The engulfing pattern suggests a potential trend reversal. The first candlestick has a small body that is completely engulfed by the second candlestick. It's referred to as a bullish engulfing pattern when it appears at the end of a downtrend and as a bearish engulfing pattern after an uptrend.\n",
            " The harami is a reversal pattern where the second candlestick is entirely contained within the first and is opposite in color. The Harami Cross has a second candlestick in a related pattern that's a doji. The open and close are effectively equal.\n",
            " Three-Day Candlestick Trading Patterns An evening star is a bearish reversal pattern in which the first candlestick continues the uptrend. The second candlestick gaps up and has a narrow body. The third candlestick closes below the midpoint of the first candlestick.\n",
            " A morning star is a bullish reversal pattern where the first candlestick is long and black/red-bodied followed by a short candlestick that has gapped lower. It's completed by a long-bodied white/green candlestick that closes above the midpoint of the first candlestick.\n",
            " How Does the Foreign Exchange Market Work?\n",
            "The foreign exchange market is frequently referred to as the forex market. Investors can buy and sell various currencies around the clock five days a week, ideally realizing a gain. As with most investments, prices can be affected by market sentiment and economic indicators. The goal is to buy low and sell high.\n",
            " Where Is the \"Real Body\" and What Does It Indicate?\n",
            "The body or \"real body\" of a candlestick chart compares the opening price and the closing price of a security so an investor can gauge which is higher and which is lower. It appears in the center of the chart as black/red if the stock closed lower or white/green if the stock closed higher.\n",
            " How Do I Interpret the Harami Cross?\n",
            "The Harami Cross appears as a small candlestick effectively tucked inside the larger one. It can be a flag of an upcoming trend reversal.\n",
            " The Bottom Line Candlestick charts depict the open, closing, high, and low prices of a security over a designated time. The shape can shrink or enlarge depending on the relationship between these prices. The color of the wide part of the candlestick indicates whether the stock closed higher or lower than the previous period.\n",
            " As with all trading tools, you’ll want to be sure that you have a firm grasp of how a candlestick chart works before you invest money based on its interpretation and implications.\n",

        "\n",
        "In CrewAI, the **Process** class is responsible for managing how tasks are executed by the crew of agents. It defines the overall workflow and collaboration patterns among agents. Essentially, the Process class abstracts away the complexities of coordinating multiple tasks and ensures that tasks are executed in an orderly and predictable manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several key aspects to the Process class:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Workflow Management:** It controls the order in which tasks are executed (for example, sequentially or in a hierarchical manner).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Task Delegation:** In certain process modes (e.g., hierarchical), it enables the delegation of tasks through a manager agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Interaction Coordination:** The process layer ensures that agents interact appropriately—whether they are working independently (as in sequential processes) or under supervision (as in hierarchical processes).\n",

        "\n",
        "  In a sequential process, tasks are executed one after the other in the order they are defined. There is no special coordination or delegation—each agent performs its assigned task, and the output of one task can feed directly into the next.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Usage Scenario:**  \n",
        "\n",
        "  This is ideal for linear workflows where the tasks have dependencies (e.g., data must be gathered before analysis) and where no additional oversight is required.\n",
