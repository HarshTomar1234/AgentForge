        "The **BaseTool** class in CrewAI is a foundational component that provides a standardized framework for building any tool you want your AI agents to use. Essentially, it’s an abstract base class that defines the interface and core behavior for all tools within the framework. By extending this class, developers can easily create custom tools with consistent behavior, robust input validation, and built-in error handling.\n",

        "## 1. What Is the BaseTool Class?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Role in CrewAI\n",
        "- **Standardization:** The BaseTool class defines a standard interface (e.g., methods and attributes) that all tools must follow. This ensures that regardless of what the tool does, it can be called in the same way by any agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Error Handling:** It often includes built-in error handling so that if something goes wrong during the execution of a tool, the framework can handle the error gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Input Validation:** By using an input schema (typically defined with Pydantic), BaseTool helps validate the inputs provided to the tool. This minimizes the risk of errors due to unexpected input types or missing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Integration:** Since all custom tools inherit from BaseTool, they automatically integrate with the CrewAI ecosystem—meaning agents can seamlessly use these tools as part of their task workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components of BaseTool\n",
        "Although you might not see every detail (as some parts may be abstracted away in the framework), the BaseTool class typically includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Attributes:**\n",
        "  - `name`: A string that identifies the tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `description`: A brief description of what the tool does.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `args_schema`: A Pydantic model that defines the expected inputs for the tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Methods:**\n",
        "  - `run()`: A public method that wraps the internal logic. It usually handles input validation (using `args_schema`) and calls the tool’s custom logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `_run()`: An abstract or placeholder method that you must override in your subclass to implement the tool’s specific functionality.\n",

        "## 2. How BaseTool Helps in Creating Custom Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "### Simplification\n",
        "When you subclass BaseTool, you only need to implement the `_run()` method that contains your tool’s logic. The BaseTool class takes care of:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Validating the input using the schema you provide.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Managing exceptions so that errors are caught and handled in a uniform way.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integrating your tool into the CrewAI workflow, making it available to agents without further configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Consistency\n",
        "By having all tools derive from BaseTool, every tool in your project will have a similar structure and behavior. This consistency simplifies:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Maintenance:** Debugging or upgrading tools is easier when they follow the same pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Interoperability:** Agents don’t need to worry about how a tool is implemented—they just call its `run()` method and expect a consistent type of output.\n",
        "\n",

        "## 3. Detailed Code Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example 1: Creating a Custom Tool by Subclassing BaseTool\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is an example that demonstrates how to create a custom search tool by subclassing BaseTool.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from crewai.tools import BaseTool\n",
        "from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n",
        "from typing import Type\n",
        "\n",
        "# Define an input schema for the tool using Pydantic\n",
        "class SearchToolInput(BaseModel):\n",
        "    query: str = Field(..., description=\"The search query for which results are needed.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create a custom tool by subclassing BaseTool\n",
        "class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool):\n",
        "    name: str = \"CustomSearchTool\"\n",
        "    description: str = \"A tool that performs a custom search and returns simulated results.\"\n",
        "    args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = SearchToolInput  # Input validation schema\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Implement the _run method with your custom logic.\n",
        "    def _run(self, query: str) -> str:\n",
        "        # Here, you would normally implement the actual search logic.\n",
        "        # For demonstration, we return a dummy string.\n",
        "        return f\"Simulated search results for '{query}'\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Instantiate and use the custom tool\n",
        "custom_tool = CustomSearchTool()\n",
        "result = custom_tool.run(query=\"CrewAI custom tools\")\n",
        "print(result)\n",
        "# Output: Simulated search results for 'CrewAI custom tools'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "1. **SearchToolInput:** This Pydantic model ensures that any input to the tool contains a valid `query` string.\n",
        "2. **CustomSearchTool:**  \n",
        "   - It defines the `name` and `description` attributes that help identify the tool in the CrewAI ecosystem.\n",
        "   - The `args_schema` is set to `SearchToolInput` so that inputs are automatically validated.\n",
        "   - The `_run()` method contains the core functionality; in this example, it simulates a search operation.\n",
        "3. **Usage:** Calling the `run()` method on the tool instance first validates the input against the schema and then calls `_run()` to produce the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example 2: Creating a Simple Tool Using the @tool Decorator\n",
        "\n",
        "For simpler scenarios where a full class definition is unnecessary, you can convert a function into a tool with a decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from crewai.tools import tool\n",
        "\n",
        "@tool(\"QuickSearch\")\n",
        "def quick_search(query: str) -> str:\n",
        "    \"\"\"\n",
        "    A simple tool that simulates a search operation.\n",
        "    Returns a dummy result for the provided query.\n",
        "    \"\"\"\n",
        "    # In an actual implementation, you might integrate API calls or other logic.\n",
        "    return f\"Quick results for '{query}'\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Use the decorated function as a tool\n",
        "print(quick_search(\"CrewAI BaseTool explanation\"))\n",
        "# Expected output: Quick results for 'CrewAI BaseTool explanation'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "- The `@tool` decorator wraps the `quick_search` function, converting it into a tool with the name \"QuickSearch.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- This method is concise and is suitable when you need to implement a straightforward operation.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Rapid Development:** By inheriting from BaseTool, you reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Input Safety:** Automatic input validation via the `args_schema` ensures your tool receives correctly structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Error Management:** Built-in error handling in the BaseTool class helps manage exceptions, making your tools more robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Seamless Integration:** All custom tools follow the same interface, so they integrate easily with CrewAI’s agent and task systems.\n",
