Despite giving a positive review of the film, Randy Cordova of the Arizona Republic found de Armas to be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"unconvincing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in her role.[35] Reeves then telephoned de Armas to invite her to star in a Spanish-language role in the thriller Daughter of God which he acted in and produced.[36] Producer Mark Downie hoped the film would be a star vehicle for de Armas, but due to executive meddling Daughter of God was severely edited with de Armas' former starring role reduced. The director Danny Boyle said that, while de Armas was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"really radiant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in her scenes, the introduction of a love triangle subplot did not test well with audiences.[49]\\\\\\\\nDe Armas's role as an immigrant nurse in the ensemble murder mystery film Knives Out (2019), written and directed by Rian Johnson, was widely praised and marked a breakthrough for the actress.[50] When first approached about the project, she was unenthusiastic about the idea of playing a stereotypical \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Latina caretaker\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but soon realized that her character was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"so much more than that. She received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, in addition to nominations for the BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG Award in the same category.[88][89]\\\\\\\\nDe Armas next starred in the Apple TV+ action comedy film Ghosted (2023).[90] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian panned the film and the lack of chemistry between de Armas and Evans.[91] She then starred in Antonio Trashorras's horror films El callej\\\\\\\\u00f3n (2011) and Anabel (2015),[30] and in the drama Por un pu\\\\\\\\u00f1ado de besos (2014).[31] During a long period without acting work,[21] de Armas participated in workshops at Tomaz Pandur's Madrid theatre company[6] and felt \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"very anxious\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" about the lack of momentum in her career.[15]\\\\\\\\nTransition to Hollywood and breakthrough (2014\\\\\\\\u20132020)[edit]\\\\\\\\nWith encouragement from her newly hired Hollywood agent, she decided to move to Los Angeles.[14]\\\\\\\"}\\\"]\"\n"

Despite giving a positive review of the film, Randy Cordova of the Arizona Republic found de Armas to be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"unconvincing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in her role.[35] Reeves then telephoned de Armas to invite her to star in a Spanish-language role in the thriller Daughter of God which he acted in and produced.[36] Producer Mark Downie hoped the film would be a star vehicle for de Armas, but due to executive meddling Daughter of God was severely edited with de Armas\\' former starring role reduced. The director Danny Boyle said that, while de Armas was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"really radiant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in her scenes, the introduction of a love triangle subplot did not test well with audiences.[49]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDe Armas\\'s role as an immigrant nurse in the ensemble murder mystery film Knives Out (2019), written and directed by Rian Johnson, was widely praised and marked a breakthrough for the actress.[50] When first approached about the project, she was unenthusiastic about the idea of playing a stereotypical \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Latina caretaker\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but soon realized that her character was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"so much more than that. She received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, in addition to nominations for the BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG Award in the same category.[88][89]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDe Armas next starred in the Apple TV+ action comedy film Ghosted (2023).[90] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian panned the film and the lack of chemistry between de Armas and Evans.[91] She then starred in Antonio Trashorras\\'s horror films El callej\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u00f3n (2011) and Anabel (2015),[30] and in the drama Por un pu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u00f1ado de besos (2014).[31] During a long period without acting work,[21] de Armas participated in workshops at Tomaz Pandur\\'s Madrid theatre company[6] and felt \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"very anxious\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" about the lack of momentum in her career.[15]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTransition to Hollywood and breakthrough (2014\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u20132020)[edit]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWith encouragement from her newly hired Hollywood agent, she decided to move to Los Angeles.[14]\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\\\\\", \\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/ana-de-armas-44631.php\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ana de Armas is a Spanish-Cuban actress who is known for her performances in the films \\'Hands of Stone\\' and \\'Blade Runner 2049.\\' She used to work in the Spanish film industry before transitioning to Hollywood.

Despite giving a positive review of the film, Randy Cordova of the Arizona Republic found de Armas to be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"unconvincing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in her role.[35] Reeves then telephoned de Armas to invite her to star in a Spanish-language role in the thriller Daughter of God which he acted in and produced.[36] Producer Mark Downie hoped the film would be a star vehicle for de Armas, but due to executive meddling Daughter of God was severely edited with de Armas\\' former starring role reduced. The director Danny Boyle said that, while de Armas was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"really radiant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in her scenes, the introduction of a love triangle subplot did not test well with audiences.[49]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDe Armas\\'s role as an immigrant nurse in the ensemble murder mystery film Knives Out (2019), written and directed by Rian Johnson, was widely praised and marked a breakthrough for the actress.[50] When first approached about the project, she was unenthusiastic about the idea of playing a stereotypical \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Latina caretaker\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but soon realized that her character was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"so much more than that. She received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, in addition to nominations for the BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG Award in the same category.[88][89]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDe Armas next starred in the Apple TV+ action comedy film Ghosted (2023).[90] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian panned the film and the lack of chemistry between de Armas and Evans.[91] She then starred in Antonio Trashorras\\'s horror films El callej\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u00f3n (2011) and Anabel (2015),[30] and in the drama Por un pu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u00f1ado de besos (2014).[31] During a long period without acting work,[21] de Armas participated in workshops at Tomaz Pandur\\'s Madrid theatre company[6] and felt \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"very anxious\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" about the lack of momentum in her career.[15]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTransition to Hollywood and breakthrough (2014\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u20132020)[edit]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWith encouragement from her newly hired Hollywood agent, she decided to move to Los Angeles.[14]\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\\\\\", \\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://peopleenespanol.com/chica/ana-de-armas-oscars-blonde-first-cuban-actress/\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ana de Armas is showing awards season that blondes have more fun with a new history-making nomination.
